# 🧪 Experiments

This directory contains numerical experiments built on top of the models in the repository.

You’ll find small, playful projects that dive into how the models behave under different conditions: how they react, stabilize, oscillate, explode (mathematically!), and how they can be analyzed, simulated, or extended. It’s a space to poke the models, twist the parameters, and see what happens.

Feel free to explore, modify, and create your own experiments.
