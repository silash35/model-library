# Ideal Gas Equation

The **Ideal Gas Equation** is a fundamental relationship in chemistry and physics that describes the behavior of an ideal gas:

$$
PV = nRT
$$

Where:

- $P$ = Pressure of the gas
- $V$ = Volume of the gas
- $n$ = Number of moles of gas
- $R$ = Ideal gas constant (8.314 J/molÂ·K)
- $T$ = Absolute temperature in Kelvin

## Assumptions of the Ideal Gas Equation

According to **Tenny KM and Cooper JS** ([PMID: 28722965](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28722965/)), using the ideal gas equation assumes **ideal gas behavior**, which is based on several simplifications and assumptions:

> - The gas particles have negligible volume compared to the total volume of a gas.
> - The gas particles are equally sized and do not have intermolecular forces, such as attraction or repulsion, with other gas particles.
> - The gas particles move randomly in agreement with Newton's laws of motion that describe kinetic energy.
> - The gas particles have perfect elastic collisions with no energy loss or gain.

This behavior is best observed at **low pressures and high temperatures**, where real gases closely approximate ideal gas conditions.
