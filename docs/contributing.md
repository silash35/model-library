# 🤝 How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Model Library**!  
There are many ways you can help make this repository better, from adding new models to improving documentation.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add More Models

You are welcome to contribute new mathematical models from any area of engineering or applied science.
Each model should be well-explained, and the code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices.
Remember, the main objective of this repository is to serve as an educational resource.

For each new model, please include the following files:

- `README.md` with:
  - The mathematical formulation
  - Model assumptions
  - Model classification
  - Optionally, the modeling process
- Implementation in a simulation tool, e.g., Python (SciPy) or MATLAB.
- Optional: a diagram illustrating the physical system the model represents.

Finally, place your model in the appropriate folder inside the `models/` directory.

### 2. Add Simulations

- Provide simulations for existing models:
  - Python scripts, MATLAB code, or other tools.
  - Plot generated data to compare with existing implementations.
  - Write concise, well-documented code following best practices.

### 3. Improve Documentation

- Fix grammar, spelling, or formatting issues in Markdown files.
- Rewrite explanations to make them clearer and easier to follow.
- Add diagrams, notes, or visual aids.

### 4. Help with References

> For more information about citation rules and copyright considerations, please consult the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md).

- Most models in this repository are widely used and considered common knowledge, so formal citation is often not required.
  However, if the original author can be identified, providing a reference is appreciated.
- If the original author cannot be determined, you may cite an article, book, or reliable source that used or derived the model.
  Including such a reference is very helpful, especially for contributors or users who intend to write a paper using the model.
