# 🤝 How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Model Library**!
There are many ways you can help make this repository better, from adding new models to improving documentation.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add More Models

You are welcome to contribute new mathematical models from any area of engineering or applied science.
Each model should be well-explained, and the code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices.
Remember, the main objective of this repository is to serve as an educational resource.

For each new model, please include the following files:

- `README.md` with:
  - The mathematical formulation
  - Model assumptions
  - Model classification
  - Optionally, the modeling process
- Implementation in a simulation tool, e.g., Python (SciPy) or MATLAB.
- Optional: a diagram illustrating the physical system the model represents.

Finally, place your model in the appropriate folder inside the `models/` directory.

### 2. Add Simulations

- Provide simulations for existing models:
  - Python scripts, MATLAB code, or other tools.
  - Plot generated data to compare with existing implementations.
  - Write concise, well-documented code following best practices.

### 3. Improve Documentation

- Fix grammar, spelling, or formatting issues in Markdown files.
- Rewrite explanations to make them clearer and easier to follow.
- Add diagrams, notes, or visual aids.

- If you find or publish a paper, book, or article that uses a model from this repository, please add it to the **Books and Publications** section.
- When adding a reference, follow **APA style** for books, articles, or other publications. Example for a book:
  - Ogata, K. (2011). _Modern control engineering_ (5th ed.). Prentice Hall.
- Including such references is especially helpful for contributors or users intending to write a paper using the model.
