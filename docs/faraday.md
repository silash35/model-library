# Faraday’s Law

The **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction** states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in any closed circuit is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.

Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$\mathcal{E} = - \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

where:

- $\mathcal{E}$ is the induced EMF in volts
- $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux

## Flux Linkage

A convenient way to express Faraday’s Law is through the concept of **flux linkage**, denoted by $\lambda$.
Flux linkage represents the total magnetic flux linked by all turns of a coil and is defined as:

$$\lambda = N \cdot \Phi_B$$
where $N$ is the number of turns in the coil.

Using flux linkage, Faraday’s Law can be written as:

$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\lambda}{dt}$$

If the coil has a fixed number of turns $N$, then:

$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d}{dt}(N\Phi_B) = -N \cdot \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

This yields the familiar textbook form of Faraday’s Law for a stationary coil:

$$\mathcal{E} = -N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

which states that the induced EMF is proportional to the number of turns and the rate of change of magnetic flux through each turn.
