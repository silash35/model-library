# Circuit Components

This section describes the fundamental circuit components commonly used in electrical and electronic circuits.
Each component is assumed to be ideal, meaning it operates exactly according to its defining equations, without losses or imperfections.

## Basic Components

### Resistor

A **resistor** is a passive component that opposes the flow of electric current.
Its constitutive equation is given by **Ohm’s Law**:

$$
V_R(t) = R \cdot I_R(t)
$$

Where:

- $V_R(t)$: voltage across the resistor [V]
- $I_R(t)$: current through the resistor [A]
- $R$: resistance [Ω]

In an ideal model, $R$ is constant and independent of temperature, frequency, or current. A resistor that behaves this way is called ohmic, producing a linear relationship between voltage and current, as described by Ohm’s Law.

### Capacitor

A **capacitor** is a passive component that stores energy in the form of an electric field.

Its constitutive equation is defined by the voltage across its terminals as a function of the stored charge:

$$
V_C(t) = \frac{q(t)}{C}
$$

Where:

- $q(t)$: charge stored in the capacitor [C]
- $V_C(t)$: voltage across the capacitor [V]
- $C$: capacitance [F]

### Inductor

An **inductor** is a passive component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field.
Its constitutive equation is:

$$
V_L(t) = L \cdot \frac{dI_L(t)}{dt}
$$

Where:

- $V_L(t)$: voltage across the inductor [V]
- $I_L(t)$: current through the inductor [A]
- $L$: inductance [H]

## Other Components and Constitutive Equations

### Diode

A diode is a semiconductor device that primarily allows current to flow in one direction, blocking it (ideally) in the reverse direction.

The diode’s behavior can be described by several models and equations, depending on the desired level of accuracy.
A common model for the diode is the **Shockley diode equation**, which describes its current-voltage behavior as:

$$
i_D = i_S \left(e^{V_D / (n V_T)} - 1 \right)
$$

Where:

- $i_D$: diode current [A]
- $V_D$: voltage across the diode [V]
- $i_S$: reverse saturation current [A]
- $n$: ideality factor
- $V_T$: thermal voltage (~26 mV at room temperature)

### Back Electromotive Force (EMF)

A **back electromotive force (EMF)**, also called **counter EMF**, is the voltage generated by a motor (or any electromechanical system) as a result of its rotation in a magnetic field.

According to **Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**, a changing magnetic flux through a coil induces a voltage proportional to the rate of change of the flux linkage.
In a DC motor, when the rotor spins, the rotating coil cuts through magnetic field lines, inducing a voltage that opposes the applied armature voltage.

The constitutive equation for the back EMF is given by:

$$
V_{emf}(t) = K \omega(t)
$$

Where:

- $V_{emf}(t)$: back electromotive force [V]
- $\omega(t)$: angular velocity of the rotor [rad/s]
- $K$: back-emf constant [V⋅s/rad]
