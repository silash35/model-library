# Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's Laws of Motion are fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the **motion of an object** and the **forces acting on it**. These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics.

## 1. Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)

Newton's First Law states that:

> A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.

This law explains the concept of **inertia**: the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion.

## 2. Newton's Second Law (Law of Acceleration)

Newton's Second Law states that:

> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

Mathematically:

$$\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$$

Where:

- $\vec{F}$: net force acting on the object [N]
- $m$: mass of the object [kg]
- $\vec{a}$: acceleration of the object [m/s²]

This law also has a rotational version for objects that can rotate about an axis:

$$\vec{\tau} = I \vec{\alpha}$$

Where:

- $\vec{\tau}$: net torque acting on the object [N·m]
- $I$: moment of inertia of the object [kg·m²]
- $\vec{\alpha}$: angular acceleration [rad/s²]

## 3. Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)

Newton's Third Law states that:

> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

This means forces always come in **pairs**: if object A exerts a force on object B, object B exerts an equal force in the opposite direction on object A.
