# Energy

**Energy** is a fundamental physical quantity that represents the ability of a system to perform work.
It exists in many forms and can be transformed from one type to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed, according to the law of conservation of energy.

Energy is measured in **joules (J)** in the International System of Units (SI).

## Kinetic Energy

**Kinetic energy** is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.
The faster an object moves, or the greater its mass, the more kinetic energy it has.

The expression for kinetic energy is:

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$

Where:

- $E_k$: kinetic energy [J]
- $m$: mass of the object [kg]
- $v$: velocity of the object [m/s]

In systems that involve **rotational motion**, such as rotating wheels or pendulums, kinetic energy also depends on the object’s moment of inertia and angular velocity.
The rotational kinetic energy is expressed as:

$$
E_{k,rot} = \frac{1}{2} J \omega^2
$$

Where:

- $E_{k,rot}$: rotational kinetic energy [J]
- $J$: moment of inertia of the object about the rotation axis [kg·m²]
- $\omega$: angular velocity [rad/s]

## Gravitational Potential Energy

**Gravitational potential energy** is the energy an object has due to its position in a gravitational field.
It represents the potential for an object to fall and convert this energy into motion.

The expression for gravitational potential energy (near Earth's surface) is:

$$
E_p = m g h
$$

Where:

- $E_p$: gravitational potential energy [J]
- $m$: mass of the object [kg]
- $g$: acceleration due to gravity ($9.81$ m/s² near Earth)
- $h$: height relative to a reference point [m]

## Elastic Potential Energy

**Elastic potential energy** is stored in materials that can be stretched or compressed, such as springs or rubber bands.
It is released when the material returns to its original shape.

The expression for elastic potential energy is:

$$
E_e = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

Where:

- $E_e$: elastic potential energy [J]
- $k$: spring constant or stiffness [N/m]
- $x$: displacement from the equilibrium position [m]
