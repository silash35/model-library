# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is a model?

The concept of a **model** is broad and has been discussed across philosophy, science, and engineering.
According to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/model), a model is:

> _“a physical object, usually smaller than the real object, that is used to represent something”_

In this sense, a map can be seen as a model of the terrain, while a maquette is a model of a building.
Both are simplified representations that help us understand, analyze, and communicate aspects of reality.

The same dictionary also provides a broader meaning:

> _“A simple representation of a system or process, especially one that can be used in calculations or predictions of what might happen.”_

This second definition captures what we call mathematical models: abstractions described by equations or algorithms. These models are essential tools for studying systems in engineering, science, and many other fields, and they are the primary focus of this repository.

In conclusion, a model can be seen as a **simplified abstraction** that highlights the most relevant aspects of a system while ignoring details that are not essential for the analysis.

## What types of models are found in this repository?

This repository contains only mathematical models described by equations. Most are derived from physical laws and can be either dynamic (typically formulated with differential equations) or static (expressed with algebraic equations). You will not find statistical or data-driven models, such as neural networks or machine learning models, as the focus here is on first-principles modeling.

## What can the models in this repository be used for?

The models in this repository are primarily intended as an educational tool, but they can be applied in many ways. You can use them to:

- **Understand and simulate** the behavior of physical, chemical, or biological systems.
- **Experiment with different parameters** to see how the system responds.
- **Adapt or expand** existing models as a starting point to represent other systems.
- **Test and validate control strategies**, both in simulations and alongside real systems.
- **Apply optimization methods** to improve processes, efficiency, or performance in simulations or industrial applications.

These models provide a practical way to learn how mathematical modeling works, while also serving as a foundation for research, project work, or extending models to new systems.

## Do I need to be an engineer to use this repository?

You do not need to be a professional engineer, but this repository assumes that you have some familiarity with **calculus, physics, and programming**. Most models involve **differential equations and physical principles**, so having a background in these areas will help you understand, simulate, and adapt the models effectively.

## Can I use the code and models from this repository?

Yes! All code in this repository is released under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), which means you are **free to use, modify, and distribute it** without restriction.

If you use the models or code in **academic work, articles, or reports**, it is recommended to **cite the original source of the model** whenever possible. The original author's copyright is maintained.

Most models in this repository are widely used and considered **common knowledge**, so formal citation is often not required.

Optionally, if your publisher allows citing GitHub repositories, you can cite this repository using the [CITATION.cff](/CITATION.cff) file included in the repository. This file contains all the metadata necessary to generate a proper citation. You can also copy the citation automatically generated by GitHub from the repository interface. We would greatly appreciate it if you cite the repository.
