# Electrical Circuits

This section of the repository is dedicated to **electrical circuit models**.

A circuit is a physical system composed of **electrical components** (such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors) connected together, through which electrical signals or currents can flow. For a detailed description of these components, see [Circuit Components](/docs/electronic-components.md).

## Assumptions

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all models in this section consider **ideal (lossless) circuits**:

- Wires have no resistance.
- Capacitors have no leakage.
- Inductors have no internal resistance.
- Voltage and current sources are ideal.

In other words, all circuit elements operate **perfectly**, following their theoretical constitutive equations without losses or imperfections.
