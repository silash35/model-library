# Van der Pol Oscillator (unforced)

The **Van der Pol oscillator** is a classical nonlinear dynamical system that exhibits self-sustained oscillations, where energy is alternately stored and dissipated depending on the system state.

Its dynamics are governed by the **Van der Pol differential equation**:

$$
\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + \mu (x(t)^2 - 1)\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + x(t) = 0
$$

Where:

- $x(t)$: state variable
- $\mu$: nonlinearity parameter ($\mu > 0$)

The state variable $x(t)$ can represent many different physical quantities depending on the context. By example, it can represent the position (in meters) of an oscillating mass, with $\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$ representing its velocity (meters per second).

> Note: This is a **second-order ODE**, so some numerical solvers may require reducing it to a system of first-order equations.
> For details on how to do this, see [Reducing Higher-Order ODEs](/docs/ode_reduction.md).
