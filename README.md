This repository brings together phenomenological mathematical models from different areas of engineering and applied sciences.
Here you will find representations of **tanks, reactors, circuits, and many other physical systems**, including:

- ✏️ The mathematical model
- 🧮 The modeling process
- 💻 The code implementation (mostly in Python)
- 📖 A detailed explanation of the system

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as an **open library of mathematical models**, useful for students, researchers, and professionals who want to:

- Understand how to formulate and solve models of physical systems
- Reuse code for simulations and analysis
- Contribute with new models and examples

## 📂 Repository structure

- `models/` → Mathematical models organized by system type
- `docs/` → Additional documentation
- `experiments/` → Explorations and activities built around the models

## 📑 Key documents

- [❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](/docs/faq.md)
- [🤝 How to Contribute](/docs/contributing.md)
- [▶️ How to Run the Python Code](/docs/python.md)
